# Arven
Arven is a sandwich value checker for Pokemon Scarlet/Violet. It allows you to select ingredients and check the buffs that will be provided by the resulting sandwich without requiring you to spend any rare ingredients in the process.

**Note:** Serebii notes that, in multiplayer, adding too many ingredients can reduce the effectiveness of a sandwich. Currently, we do not have a way to account for this effect as we do not know at what point it kicks in.
